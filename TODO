- Record.php and Domain.php share some methods, 
  I would like to mixin these methods from some other class (, but multiple inheritance isn't supported by PHP).
  - http://www.scriptorama.nl/tips-tricks/re-mixins-in-php
  - http://loveandtheft.org/2008/03/22/php-style-mixins/

- Zone should be erased when Domain is destroyed

- cd /tmp/activerecord && svn update &&
  diff -uBb /tmp/activerecord/ ~pkuijv/public_html/petje/inc/classes/activerecord/ --exclude=config.php --exclude=.svn > /tmp/activerecord.diff
  and commit diff to luke baker. (PK 2008/07/22 : Done, emailed luke@lukebaker.org)

- domain_list.php outputs wrong username (domain.account should be NULL, domain -> zone -> user should be the owner).

- images should all be 16x16 png's ! Not gif's!

- validate html for each page

- example for type in record_add.php

- do something with http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/ 

- use the http://famfamfam.com/ icons

- Forms submit via '<form onsubmit'>. 

- create support for users

- create support for groups, add users to a group, add zones to a group instead of adding to a user. 
  This way all members of a group are able to edit and update their zones.
